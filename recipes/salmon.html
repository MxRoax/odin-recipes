        <p>
            There&rsquo;s <em>nothing</em> better to cook up as a middle-of-the-week, savory treat like a simple salmon filet. 
            It&rsquo;s hearty and packed with nutrients that pairs well with just about any carb and any vegetable. 
            Similar to many fish filets, they can have an impeccably quick defrost time mdash; 
            meaning you can think of dinner at noon and have it neatly plated by evening.
