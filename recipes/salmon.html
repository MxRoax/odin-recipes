        <p>
            There&rsquo;s <em>nothing</em> better to cook up as a middle-of-the-week, savory treat like a simple salmon filet. 
            It&rsquo;s hearty and packed with nutrients that pairs well with just about any carb and any vegetable. 
            Similar to many fish filets, they can have an impeccably quick defrost time; 
            meaning you can think of dinner at noon and have it neatly plated by evening.

        <p>
            In this recipe, we will be creating a basic panseared-salmon, though that just means that once you get a hang of the process 
            you can experiment with whatever seasons or spices that you wish. If you&rsaquo;re feeling particularly fancy, 
            you can make a glaze or sauce to top it all off.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Oil or Butter</li>
            <li>Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Fillet(s), whatever you think is a reasonable amount</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Season your salmon fillets with salt and pepper.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Crank your stove up to around medium-high heat, and add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. Wait until hot.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add salmon (there is much debate on which side goes first, so play around with whatever method you like) and leave it be for a few minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Once the salmon is ready you&rsaquo;ll be able to <em>gently</em> lift it from the pan without any resistance. If you&rsaquo;re having any trouble, let it sit for a little longer and try again.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cook the remaining side to your preference and serve.</li>
        </ol>
