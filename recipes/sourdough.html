        <p>Just about everything is better homemade, especially bread! While it may take a pinch more time and a handful of elbow grease, by the end you'll be enjoying more than just the fruits of your labor.

                <li>Dutch oven</li>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>60 mg sourdough starter (about 1/4)</li>
                <li>340 grams water (about 1 1/3 cup plus 2 table spoons)</li>
                <li>10 grams salt (about 1 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
                <li>500 grams bread flour (about 3 2/3 cups)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>In this first step we are assuming you have a ripe, active, and bubbly sourdough starter.</em> With that starter you will mix all of your starter, water, bread flour, and salt into a large bowl and mix together until all the flour is encorporated and a shaggy dough is formed.</li>
                <br>
                <li>This step will include a lot of waiting: Cover the dough and let it rest in a warm place (around 76&deg;F) for 10-12 hours, in which it will both strengthen and double in size.</li>
                <br>
                <li>After it has double in size, drop your dough onto a clean countertop and, with damp hands, form into a ball</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cover and let rise for another 1-2 hours, until relaxed and puffed up.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Place the dutch oven into the oven and <em>then</em> begin preheating both the oven and dutch oven to 500&deg;F for 20 minutes.
                    <p>Now that your dutch oven is nice and toasty, add in your parchment paper and dough into the dutch oven. With the top on bake for 25 minutes on 450&deg;F. Once those 25 minutes are up, continue baking for 20 more minutes with the top of the dutch oven off.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Pull the bread out the oven and let cool before enjoying.</li>
            </ol>
